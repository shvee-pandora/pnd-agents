long_description: |
  The Technical Debt Agent performs READ-ONLY analysis to identify, classify, 
  prioritize, and explain technical debt across a repository. It uses static 
  analysis, repository context, and optional SonarCloud integration.
  
  Key capabilities:
  - Repository-wide debt scanning
  - TODO/FIXME/deprecated pattern detection
  - Debt classification by type and severity
  - Impact assessment and prioritization
  - SonarCloud integration for additional metrics
  - Actionable reports for engineers and leadership
  
  This agent NEVER modifies code - it only analyzes and reports.
