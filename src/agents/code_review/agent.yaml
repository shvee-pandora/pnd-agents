long_description: |
  The Code Review Agent performs comprehensive code validation using a 3-tier 
  standards hierarchy: Pandora Standards (primary), Context7 Framework Standards, 
  and Universal JS/TS Standards.
  
  Key capabilities:
  - Standards validation against Pandora coding guidelines
  - Architecture review (INS-2509 patterns)
  - Accessibility audit (WCAG compliance)
  - TypeScript strict mode validation
  - PR commenting with actionable feedback
  
  The agent enforces a "Review Budget" of max 10 findings per review, prioritizing
  by impact: security > correctness > maintainability.
