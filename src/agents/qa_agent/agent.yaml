long_description: |
  The QA Agent validates that implementations meet their test cases and 
  acceptance criteria. It can receive test cases from user input or from 
  previous workflow stages (like the Unit Test Agent).
  
  Key capabilities:
  - Implementation validation against specs
  - Acceptance criteria verification
  - Scenario testing execution
  - Test case validation
  - Integration test validation
